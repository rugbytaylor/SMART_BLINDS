# SMART BLINDS PROJECT
## Raspberry Pi Zero W
This is the original code I wrote to be used on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Updated code with more features on the main branch.

This contains the C files for the smart blinds project. All of the files in the time_spins folder are to run the blinds at specific times of the day. The button_blinds file is the compiled file to be running 24/7.
