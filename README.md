# SMART BLINDS PROJECT
## Raspberry Pi Zero W
This is the original code I wrote to be used on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Updated code with more features on the main branch.

Began Jan 2025

All of the files in the `time_spins` folder are to run the blinds at specific times of the day. The `button_blinds.c` file is the file to be running 24/7.
