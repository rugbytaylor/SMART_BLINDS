# SMART_BLINDS
This is the code to the embedded C smart blinds project

dec 15, 7:50pm update notes
- need to test current code with hardware to verify its working
- build CI/CD pipeline (with unit tests!)
- work on transitioning to use potentiometer or stepper motor

## Future updates
- motor changes: 28BYJ-48 stepper motor?? (from chat)
- make a full OTA system for this
