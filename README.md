# SMART_BLINDS
This is the C code for my smart blinds project for an ESP32

dec 12, 10:34pm update notes
- need to copy code from master branch to `main.c` and `blinds_SM.c`
- need to format old code into new State Machine(SM) setup
- build CI/CD pipeline (with unit tests!)
- in the future: make a full OTA system with this

- chat said to implement with 28BYJ-48 stepper motor??
